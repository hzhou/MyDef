        MyDef repositories are separated into base repository and individual output-module repositories. Output modules depend on the $(code:MyDef) base code and implements language or application specific features. The base repository implements features that are common to all output modules.
    $call subsection, install_base, install base $(code:MyDef)
    $p
        Check your system have $(code:perl), $(code:make), $(code:git) installed. To install MyDef for the first time, use the bootstrap script as following:
        &call codeprint, sh
            $ git clone https://github.com/hzhou/MyDef.git
            $ cd MyDef
            $ sh bootstrap.sh
    $p
        By default, bootstrap.sh installs into $(code:$HOME/bin), $(code:$HOME/lib/perl5), and $(code:$HOME/lib/MyDef). In order to make MyDef work, you also need set following environment variables, preferably inside your $(code:~/.bashrc):
        &call codeprint, vim
            export PATH=$HOME/bin:[rest of your path]
            export PERL5LIB=$HOME/lib/perl5
            export MYDEFLIB=$HOME/lib/MyDef
        If these environment variables are set first, $(code:bootstrap.sh) will install into the specified destination instead.
    $p
        It is also recommended to keep MyDef repository after installation. You will need the base repository to install additional output-modules. For that matter, you will also need to set environment variable $(code:MYDEFSRC):
        &call codeprint, vim
            export MYDEFSRC=[path to your MyDef repository]

    $p
        MyDef repository can be updated by running $(code:git pull). During the bootstrap process, a $(code:Makefile) is created so upon updates or files been locally edited, you may simply run $(code:make) to install the updates:
        &call codeprint
            $ make
            $ make install
        You may need to run $(code:mydef_make) to update the $(code:Makefile) sometime when new files have been added or removed from the repository.
    
subcode:: sections
    $call subsection, install_what, What is installed
    $p
        The following are installed in $(code:$HOME/bin) (they are all perl scripts):
    &call whats
        $call li, mydef_page, compiles from $(code:.def) to output(s).
        $call li, mydef_make, checks $(code:.def) files in the current folder and $(code:config) file if exist, output $(code:Makefile).
        $call li, mydef_run, convenient script to compile and run a single program.
        $call li, mydef_install, installs files into $(code:$MYDEFLIB), $(code:$PERL5LIB), or the first location of $(code:$PATH).

    $p
        The following are installed in $(code:$PERL5LIB):
    &call whats
        $call li, mydef.pm, defines global variables, loads output_modules, etc.
        $call li, MyDef/parseutil.pm, defines routines for loading $(code:.def) files.
        $call li, MyDef/compileutil.pm, defines routines for translating into output, defines macros and preprocessing functions.
        $call li, MyDef/dumpout.pm, defines routines for final output.
        $call li, MyDef/utils.pm, defines some helper routines.
        $call li, MyDef/output_general.pm, the default output module.
        $call li, MyDef/output_perl.pm, output module for perl code.
    $p
        The following are installed in $(code:$MYDEFLIB):
    &call whats
        $call li, std_general.def, macros automatically loaded by output_general.pm; by default it is empty.
        $call li, std_perl.def, macros automatically loaded by output_perl.pm

    $p
        These are the essential files that are needed for basic $(code:MyDef) functions. There may be additional files being installed, which may add debugging functions or extra def libraries.

    subcode: whats
        $ul
            BLOCK

        subcode: li(name, @what)
            $li
                <b>$(name):</b> $(what)

subcode:: sections
    $call subsection, install_module, Install additional output_modules
    $p
        The base $(code:MyDef) installs $(code:output_general.pm) and will be used by default when no module option is given -- in $(code:config) file, $(code:.def) source, or on the command line of $(code:mydef_page) or $(code:mydef_run). $(code:output_general) only translates base $(code:MyDef) macros and preprocessing directives, and it can be used to generate any text files, including $(code:.txt), $(code:.pl), $(code:.c), or source code for any programming languages. The extension of the output files can be individually specified inside the $(code:.def) source. By default, $(code:.txt) is assumed.
    $p
        Although $(code:output_general) module can be used for any programming language, language or application specific output modules can be developed to add language specific features. For example, the $(code:output_perl) and $(code:output_c) modules can automatically add semicolons or curly braces as needed so the programmer can optionally omit them. $(code:output_c) also can manage automatic variable and function declaration with some type inference logic. For another example, $(code:output_win32) can add features that automatically manage $(code:WNDPROC) message handlers to make win32 programming more flexible.
    $p
        Other than $(code:output_general) and $(code:output_perl), all output modules have their own repositories and need to be individually installed. To install these additional output_modules, you need make sure that you have the updated base $(code:MyDef) repository, and have environment variable $(code:$MYDEFSRC) points to its location. The installation process are very similar for all modules. For example, $(code:output_c) module can be installed like this:
    &call codeprint, sh
        $ git clone https://github.com/hzhou/output_c.git
        $ cd output_c
        $ mydef_make
        $ make
        $ make install

    $p
        It will compile and install $(code:output_c.pm) into $(code:$PERL5LIB/MyDef/), $(code:std_c.def) and some other standard def libraries into $(code:$MYDEFLIB).
    $p
        The following output_modules are currently available from $(url:https://github.com/hzhou/): <br>
        <code>output_c, output_python, output_java, output_www, output_win32, output_xs, output_fortran, output_pascal, output_tcl, output_go, output_rust, output_glsl</code> <br/>
        Not all modules are equally developed or tested.
