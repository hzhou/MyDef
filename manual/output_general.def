    $p
        In this chapter, we will explain the internals of $(code:MyDef).
    $p
        $(code:output_general) is the default output module. It essentially only uses the syntax we have covered so far; nothing more.
    $p
        However, much of the power of $(code:MyDef) eventually will come from language or application specific output modules. So at some point, you would need to understand some of $(code:MyDef)'s internal working. $(code:output_general) module is the starting point for every output module.

    $call subsection, general_code, $(code:output_general.def)
    
    &call codeprint, mydef
        include: output.def

        page: output_general, output_main
            type: pm
            output_dir: lib/MyDef
            ext: txt
            package: MyDef::output_general
