Documentation are now available at http://huizhou.gitbooks.io/programming-with-mydef/

MyDef is not a new programming language. It is an additional layer on top of your programming language -- a layer that can do almost anything without affect the demands of the underlying language. The layer can be very thin, in which case you still write your code exactly the same way you used to. And you should if you never had complain in programming career. But if you do, MyDef allows you to do something about it. 

* I have always complained about semicolons. Now with MyDef, I don't type them anymore. 
* I have complained about curly braces. Now with MyDef, I avoided them, along with the grammatical parentheses.
* I have wished to refactor my code without worry about variable scopes. MyDef allows me to refactor with no side effects.
* I have wished a less uglier way to write JavaScript, with MyDef, I liked the new look.
* ...

Before you ask what good does MyDef can give you, recall what bad you have complained, and MyDef offers a solution -- without changing your language and still allowing collaborate with your fellow coworkers even when they are stuck in their primal language. 

MyDef is not just syntax, it is about paradigm. If you have a vision on how you think to program, MyDef can realize them. 

INSTALL
=======

1. MyDef currently is in perl. First setup a custome installation environment:
    PATH=$PATH:~/bin
    PERL5LIB=~/lib/perl5
    MYDEFLIB=~/lib/MyDef
    export PATH PERL5LIB MYDEFLIB

    The purpose is to install into one's home directory rather than system folders. I assume it is understood that /home/hzhou should be replaced with your own home directory on your specific computer.

2. Now install it:
    sh bootstrap.sh

3. Now read the [documentation]( http://huizhou.gitbooks.io/programming-with-mydef)

4. Try it.

5. If you use vim, there is simple mydef syntax.
    vim ~/.vim/filetype.vim
	augroup filetypedetect
	au BufNewFile,BufRead *.def setf mydef
	augroup END
    ln -s /path/to/MyDef/docs/mydef.vim ~/.vim/syntax/
